App Title: Athlete Training Journal

Through this app, athletes will log their daily journal regarding athletic training they had on that day.
They will write 1. the date, 2. something that they heard from coaches that's important for them to remember, 3. goal for that day of workout, 
and 4. exercises that they have done.

The age group of this app will be from middle school to high school age. The team wants to keep the athletes with good academic progress,
minimal daily habit (such as doing house chores), and good amount of rest/digest time. So 1:M relationship will store their input regarding
those aspects. Each day of recording progress (1:), they will log school progress, chore, and amount of rest/nutrition they had (:M)

The app will also have recommended training regimen from themselves or from coaches. The stored data will have M:M relationship with the main
schema. In each day of training that they log (M:), recommended drills (:M) will be listed and suggested to be completed. Once it's complete,
they can click the icon and move from 'to complete' side to 'completed' side.
